    <h1 id="boratitle">Bora Bora</h1>

    <h2 id="bora" class="paragraph">
      Bora Bora is a small South Pacific island northwest of Tahiti in French
      Polynesia. Surrounded by sand-fringed motus (islets) and a turquoise
      lagoon protected by a coral reef, itâ€™s known for its scuba diving. It's
      also a popular luxury resort destination where some guest bungalows are
      perched over the water on stilts. At the island's center rises Mt.
      Otemanu, a 727m dormant volcano.
